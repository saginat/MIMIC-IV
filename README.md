# Readmission Prediction using MIMIC IV Database
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that predicts patient readmission using the MIMIC IV database. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## About the MIMIC IV Database
The MIMIC IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database is a publicly available database of deidentified electronic health records of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) from 2008 to 2019. It contains data on over 60,000 ICU admissions and includes demographics, clinical notes, laboratory test results, medication orders, and more.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. The model is trained on a subset of the MIMIC IV database, using features such as age, sex, comorbidities, laboratory values, and medications. The model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict patient readmission using the MIMIC IV database. The results of the model can be used to identify patients who are at risk of readmission and provide them with targeted interventions to reduce the likelihood of readmission.
